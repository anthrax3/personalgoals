Personal Goals
==============

I love writing lists; they keep my on track & help me organize my prioritizes. I was inspired by [Una Kravet](http://twitter.com/una)'s [Personal Goals Repo](https://github.com/una/personal-goals) â€” read more about her approach [here](http://una.github.io/personal-goals-guide/) â€” to use GitHub to open source my goals. It's a great way to have better accessibility, transparency & (most of all) accountability. 

Check out what I'm working on ðŸ‘€

## Overarching Goals
1. Contribute to Open Source.
2. Get my first engineering job.
3. Start or co-organize a meetup.
4. Get better at advanced JavaScript.
5. Learn about back end & become a full stack developer.
6. Give back to the community by mentoring those that come after me.
